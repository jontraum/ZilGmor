# ZilGmor
ZilGmor is a mobile app for reading and studying Jewish holy texts. The current version supports Tanach (the Jewish Bible), Mishna, and Talmud Bavli along with many commentaries. Future versions will support even more. The app currently requires internet access, as it gets its content from the [Sefaria Project's](https://www.sefaria.org/) open [API](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/wiki#developers).

## But why? Isn't there already a Sefaria mobile app?
Yes there is. You can find it in the Goole Play and Apple app stores. It is very complete, and I still recommend it, as it has many features, texts, and translations that are not yet available in _ZilGmor_. However, I have found in many cases its user interface is difficult to use. For ZilGmor I have implemented several improvements:

- Make it easier to go quickly from one text to another, especially if you are going back to texts that you have recently studied
  - The list of previous texts you've studied is easer to get to (just one button click) and easier to use (one listing per text instead of listing each and every verse you've read)
  - The Library page (i.e. the list of available texts) is easy to get to (again, just one button click) and easier to scroll through to find the text you're looking for
- Remember not only where you left of on a text, but which commentaries and other links (e.g quotations from other texts) you were using last time
- Sefaria's text layout has H U M O N G O U S margins which make inefficent use of small screens. ZilGmor uses the limited space more effectively to display more text at at a time
- Sefaria loads rather slowly, not only when initializing the app, but also when loading a book

## You're using Sefaria's content in your app? Is that kosher?
Yes! Sefaria [encourages](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/wiki/Projects-Powered-by-Sefaria) others to user their content, for which I am extremely grateful.

## ZilGmor? What does that even mean?
The name comes from a [famous story from the Talmud](https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.31a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en) in which a gentile makes a request to be converted to Judaism on the condition that he be taught the entire Torah while he stands on one foot. The great sage Hillel told him "That which is hateful to you do not do to another; that is the entire Torah, and the rest is its interpretation. Go study." In the original Aramaic, that last bit "Go Study" is "Zil Gmor".
